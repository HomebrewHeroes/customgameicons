Only use names of subdirectories, these subdirectories have icons:

#drive-icon01-[01000F20122FA000].jpg

In this example, this file is in 0-9 (subdirectory)

The name of the game is #drive

The icon name is icon01
The title id of the game on nintendo switch is: 01000F20122FA000 because it is in the [] square brackets.

For a game like this, 1-2-switch-icon-001-[01000320000CC000].jpg

The game name retrieved should be 1 2 switch

the icon name: icon-001
Title id for nintendo switch game: 01000320000CC000

Can you make it use these files as well as the ones already in the .json file.

All authors of these icons are sodasoba (In json file the author is linked)

E.g https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sodasoba1/NSW-Custom-Game-Icons-square/main/Default/C/Castle-of-Shikigami-2-icon001-%5B010061E018D3C000%5D.jpg is the full link of a game

Template is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sodasoba1/NSW-Custom-Game-Icons-square/main/Default/<subdirectory><fulliconnamewithend>

Full icon name with end would be Castle-of-Shikigami-2-icon001-%5B010061E018D3C000%5D.jpg in this case.
